Object Oriented programming
It involves programming using objects.
Object: It represents an entity/objects in the real world
An object has some state, a behaviour and an identity

State: The state of an object represents the data field of the obect with
their current values
-Also called attributes/properties
-For example, a point object: x and y are data field, rectangle: length and breadth,
circle: radius, pen: color of ink, price, ink left

Behaviour: Defined by the methods of an object.
-The behaviour of an object is also called its action.
-To invoke/call a method on an object is to ask the object to perform an action.
example: str.charAt(2);
example: getArea();
example: getPerimeter();

Identity: What makes an object unique, i.e memory address
Point p1 = new Point(1, 0);
Point p2 = new Point(1, 0);
//Since they both have same class => they have same state and behaviour, but their
identity is different
System.out.println(p1 == p2); //false, as it will compare their memory locations
